"bilexis-grammar" project is an educational application that focuses on grammar topics. The project allows users to select a topic, read a brief explanation, and then engage in an interactive experience with multiple-choice questions and answers. The project retrieves data from an API and utilizes HTML library for the topic explanations.
Please note that the project is currently on hold due to the API servers being unavailable or the lack of interaction with the project manager. The project incorporates various elements such as API integration, library usage, BLoC pattern, and DAO repository. Kindly note that the shared video does not represent the final version of the project.
